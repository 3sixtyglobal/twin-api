# 3Sixty API

This repository provides a modular API stack for defining contracts, implementing services, exposing server endpoints, and consuming those endpoints from client applications. The packages are designed to work together so teams can compose reliable API capabilities without duplicating cross-cutting concerns such as routing, request processing, authentication, and tenant context handling.

Alongside the core API building blocks, the repository also includes entity storage authentication and tenant processing components that can be adopted independently or integrated into a broader platform architecture. The overall goal is to keep API development consistent, maintainable, and straightforward to extend across different deployment contexts.
